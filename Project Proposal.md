# Pacific Resources Group Business Website Proposal


## Description:

This project is to create a website for my fatherâ€™s business. Ideally this project will display some of the work he has done, recommendations from industry professionals, and credentials as well as contact information. This project will ideally utilize react as a framework and sass for styling. This project will consist mainly of front end as there is really no call for a back end I can see although I would like to implement some as a stretch goal if possible.


## Use Case:

As stated above, this is a website for my father's business, which is currently an analog relic in a digital age. He has had several domains for his business for many many years but has never used them in any way. He has relied solely on word of mouth to get his name out there. This project will ideally help boost the company's visibility and ease of access by providing a way to find out the kind of work he does and a way to get in contact.

 Creating a user friendly & easy to navigate UI

 Appropriate routing to each page on the website

## Final Thoughts:

This is a project I have wanted to undertake for many years, however now I have the skill set to make it happen myself. While this project lacks in the backend functionality, I feel making a website that is intuitive and easy to use while being visually pleasing will be a challenge in itself. I also have been very curious about learning SASS since my first teamweek project and this will give me a perfect opportunity to utilize SASS as a resource!
